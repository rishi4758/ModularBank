# Technology stack
 TypeScript - because it provide static type checking  which helps to identify errors earlier and it Improved maintainability, code consistency, and future browser support.  
 Redux - for state management and provides global accessibility that helps to build applications that work frequently and are easy to test.  
 Material-ui  - for styling various components.  
 babel- for converting code into previous version and make it compatible to run in all machine.  
 webpack - for bundling and minification of all files.  
 
 To optimise the bundle route-based code-splitting is done with lazy loading of components.  
 Hooks are used instead of classes and  instead of importing whole module of material ui only specific modules are imported.  
 code can be optimize more by eject and setting webpack configuration to reduce bundle size.
